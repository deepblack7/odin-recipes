    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Chocolate</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch round cake pan; set aside. </li>
        <li>Combine sugar, water, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until completely dissolved; set aside. </li>
        <li>Melt bittersweet chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour chocolate into the bowl of an electric mixer. </li>
        <li>Cut butter into pieces; beat butter, one piece at a time, into chocolate until combined. </li>
        <li>Beat in hot sugar water. Slowly beat in eggs, one at a time. </li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared cake pan. </li>
        <li>Have a pan larger than the cake pan ready; put the cake pan in the larger pan and fill the larger pan with boiling water halfway up the sides of the cake pan. </li>
        <li>Bake cake in the water bath in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. The center will still look wet. Place cake in the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled, 8 hours to overnight. </li>
        <li>To unmold, dip the bottom of the cake pan in hot water for 10 seconds and invert onto a serving plate. </li>
    </ol>
